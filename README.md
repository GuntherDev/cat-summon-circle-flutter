# A little about me

Hello, My Name is Gunther Nunes, I'm currently 27 years old. I started to study Flutter about 
3 months ago duo to the college graduation project.

I decided to use this time that I'm studying to create an application mixing learning with my 
personal tastes. I really like games a lot, I decided to create something that would be useful for 
the community of one of these games, a kind of database or "wiki". (Still under development by the way).

I got this challenge through my classmate who followed my personal project closely and helped me a 
lot with it.

So... I gained this opportunity to use the knowledge I have been acquiring and develop this 
challenge provided by Azumo. I admit I am very happy to receive this opportunity, I hope you like it.

# The Challenge itself

The challenge was to create an interface that contained a button to search for cat gifs.
the fetch was done using the API [CATAAS](https://cataas.com/#/).

I took the liberty of adding some visuals, I put a summoning circle as a reference to the Fate series (japanese animation). 
So when you hit the button, you would be "summoning" a new cat.

# Dependencies

I used the following dependencies during the project:

- [Build_runner:](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) Code generation.
- [Dio:](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) HTTP client for Dart. (Also best Jojo's Bizarre Adventure villain).
- [GetX:](https://pub.dev/packages/get) State manager.
- [Google_fonts:](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) Used on the texts.
- [Retrofit:](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) Dio client that makes consuming Rest APIs easier.
